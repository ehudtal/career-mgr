# Monkey-patch the CAS gem so we can use it without losing the database
# features we use for SSO - we still manage the users here, including
# their passwords in this database, but we want to use the CAS server
# for typical user login so it is seamless with Canvas.
#
# As a result, we do want database_authenticatable, and it is nice to keep
# its routes as a fallback. We just ALSO want cas_authenticatable and would
# prefer to use its routes in the views when we can.
#
# Without this, database_authenticatable and cas_authenticatable are incompatible
# because they both try to define user_sign_in_path, etc.

ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper.class_eval do
  # This code is copy/pasted from the devise_cas_authenticatable gem's source code,
  # then modified to fit our interoperability requirements and rubocop's whining.

  # The main change is the path names are suffixed with '_sso' now.
